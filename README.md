**Student & Casual Learner**  
Literally, random stuff.

## What have I tried?
As said, random stuff.
The only "real" thing being the half-baked repo on My profile, it's not even the original Flask version. 
Did understand some stuff, but still.

I would like to contribute to simple things, in which i also learn.
If anybody wants to reach out, I'll definetly see. It better be fun enough tho.
